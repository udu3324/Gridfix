# Gridfix
Gridfix is a client side fabric mod that allows you to fix movement to a grid/reference. It requires fabric-api as well, modmenu as optional.

## Features
Gridfix has many features that can lock the mouse or help guide movement. They are under the `/gridfix <feature>` command. No features automate any movement or replicate any impossible behavior.
